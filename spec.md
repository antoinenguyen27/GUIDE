This project is a simple tool for a robot. 

It works by using a live LLM through a service like gemini live api.

It is a simple framework, that uses a VLM to identify the preferences of something. For example, the location on where objects in the kitchen should be stored, what home cleaning items the owner prefers to use and in what order.
